# ed-vimrc
My personal vim configuration.

## Requirements
Optimised for vim version 8.1.

*Requires compiled Python 3 and system clipboard support.*

## Usage
Clone this repo into your `~/.vim` folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:ed-cooper/ed-vimrc.git ~/.vim
```

Then, initialise the submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This configuration also assumes use of the powerline patched fonts, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

**Note:** I cannot guarantee any compatibility between settings in this repo and any pre-existing changes made to your personal `~/.vimrc` file.
